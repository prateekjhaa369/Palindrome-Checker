## Palindrome Checker Using Stack and Queue ðŸŒ€

This is a **console-based Java application** that checks whether a given input string is a **palindrome** using core Java data structures â€” **Stack** and **Queue**. The project was developed as part of an academic course at **Lovely Professional University**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

A **palindrome** is a word, phrase, or number that reads the same forwards and backwards (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case). This project reads input from the user, processes it, and checks if it's a palindrome by comparing characters using a **Stack (LIFO)** and a **Queue (FIFO)**.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Accepts user input via command-line
- Cleans input using **Regular Expressions**
- Implements logic using **Stack and Queue**
- Case-insensitive and ignores non-alphanumeric characters
- Displays a message based on whether the input is a palindrome or not

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Java (Core)** â€” Programming Language
- **Java Collections Framework** â€” Stack and Queue (LinkedList)
- **Regex** â€” For input sanitization
- **Visual Studio Code** â€” IDE used for development
- **JDK 17+** â€” For compiling and executing the code
- **Command Line / Terminal** â€” To run the application
